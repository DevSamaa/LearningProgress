# Acceleration Plan for Protégés in the Future Makers Academy - Quorum 2
​
This is a working document which we can use to plot a protégé's progress as they work their way through the Protégé Acceleration program. The aim is to prepare for the Second Quorum review. This is a **guide** and should be used as a reference to help the protégé to focus learning and track their progress. Please note that this checklist is what is considered the minimum knowledge and experience which the protégé should have. Protégés are encouraged to dive deeper into the subjects to enhance their learning.

You should refer to the Acceleration page of the Protégé's handbook for further details: https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FMA/pages/1022724705/Acceleration
