# Acceleration Plan for Protègès in the Future Makers Academy
​
This is a working document which we can use to plot a protégé's progress as they work their way through the Protégé Acceleration program. The aim is to prepare for the first Quorum review.
​
This is a **DRAFT** and is very much open for debate!
​
## Foundations
​
The Foundations part of Acceleration program includes these topics:
​
* [Git Basics](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/git-basics.md)
* [Keyboard Confidence](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/keyboard-confidence.md)
* [Editor Confidence](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/editor-confidence.md)
* [Unix Command Line](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/unix-command-line.md)
* [Pair Programming](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/general/collaboration/pair-programming.md)
* [Foundational Programming](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/foundational-programming.md)
​
### Git Basics
​
The protégé will have demonstrated an understanding of the following concepts and used them while completing katas:
​
- [ ] Creating a repository
- [ ] Cloning a repository
- [ ] Creating branches
- [ ] Merging branches
- [ ] Pushing branches
- [ ] Creating a pull request
- [ ] Reviewing a pull request, commenting on, approving, and merging a pull request
​
### Keyboard Confidence
​
They will have demonstrated the ability to type on the keyboard as a way of interacting with the computer. The keyboard should not be seen as a hinderance, or an obstacle, simply one way which you can interact with a computer. Touch typing is not a requirement.
​
### Editor Confidence
​
They should choose an editor and become efficient using it. It would be great to be familiar with a second editor, but efficient use is not a requirement.
​
- [ ] Can use keyboard shortcuts, and knows how to find them for commands
- [ ] Can use the refactor function to rename variables, method names, classes, etc.
- [ ] Is aware of ways of extending the editor through the use of plugins/extensions or configuration options
- [ ] Can open the editor from the command line
​
### Unix Command Line
​
They should be comfortable using the command line and will have demonstrated this through the following:
​
- [ ] Has completed the four checkpoints in the Unix Command Line page in General_Developer repo
- [ ] Has written two different bash scripts to help with automating repeated operations
- [ ] Has customised their prompt on their computer
​
### Pair Programming
​
They should have demonstrated their understanding of the different ways of pair programming and will have practiced this technique with different people.
​
### Foundational Programming
​
They should be aware of the following concepts, be able to describe what they are, and have used them while completing katas. These are all to be demonstrated in C# (the language of choice for Proteges):
​
- [ ] Variables & Types
- [ ] If / Else & Case Statements
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Methods & Functions
- [ ] Collections (List, Dictionary/HashSet)
- [ ] Looping
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Classes - Public / Private / Protected Methods
- [ ] Classes - Static methods vs Instance methods
- [ ] Classes - Constructor & passing values through a constructor
- [ ] Classes - Private / Protected Variables
- [ ] Inheritance with classes (and why it should usually be avoided)
- [ ] Composition with classes (why this is usually better than inheritance)
- [ ] Interfaces
- [ ] Exceptions
​
## Language Design
​
The Foundations part of Acceleration program includes these topics:
​
* [Four Rules of Simple Design](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/design/four-rules-of-simple-design.md)
* [Test Driven Development](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/testing/tdd.md)
* [Test Doubles](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/testing/test-doubles.md)
* [You Ain't Gonna Need It - YAGNI](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/yagni.md)
* [Command Query Seperation](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/command-query-separation.md)
* [Object Composition](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/things-we-value/technical/programming/object-composition.md)
* Whiteboarding
​
### Four Rules of Simple Design
​
Based on Kent Beck's recommendation there are four simple rules which if you follow them will help you build good quality software. They should be able to explain and demonstrate use of the following concepts:
​
- [ ] Code Passes the Tests
- [ ] Reveals Intention - it is easy to understand what the program is doing by reading the code
- [ ] No Duplication - do not repeat yourself
- [ ] Fewest elements - do not write more than you need to
​
The protégé should strive for Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> Classes, methods and variable names are named to reveal mainly technical concepts with occasional naming revealing specific domain examples. Comments are very rarely used.
​
> Repeatable patterns are identified based on code duplication. Duplicate code patterns are consistently pulled out into supporting methods or classes.
​
> Classes and methods are broken up into small components with clear responsibilities. Methods are consistently kept small.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### Test Driven Development
​
They should follow the guidelines of Test Driven Development in completing the katas. They should strive to achieve at least Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> The basic TDD cycle is followed where in general each time new functionality is added to the solution an appropriate test is written first.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### Test Doubles
​
They should use where appropriate Test Doubles when testing their code. They should strive to achieve at least Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> Leverages a test framework to utilize out of the box test doubles. Can articulate what type of test double the test framework is providing for different test scenarios. Able to swap out parts of the solution code base with appropriate test double framework implementations to isolate behaviour for testing.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### You Ain't Gonna Need It - YAGNI
​
They should demonstrate that they understands the YAGNI concept, and uses it when working on the katas being worked on. They should strive to achieve at least Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> Generally applies YAGNI principles when solving problems. Delays implementing code capabilities to support presumptive features. Solution design focusses on solving the problem at hand without gold-plating.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### Command Query Separation
​
They should understand and demonstrate usage of the Command Query Separation concept. They should be able to explain it to other Proteges. They should strive for at least Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> Generally applies command query separation when writing methods.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### Object Composition
​
They should demonstrate their knowledge of object oriented programming, and be able to explain the differences between composition and inheritance, and where you should consider using either approach. They should prefer object composition when solving katas. They should strive for Level 3 which is defined as:
​
> Can implement object composition in coding problems. Consistently applies composition over inheritance in code.
​
- [ ] Achieved Level 3
​
### Whiteboarding
​
Being able to sketch out designs or diagrams to explain how code or systems work is an essential skill. You don't need to know [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) but you should be able to sketch out diagrams which will aid in explaining systems, code, or user interfaces. They should be able to demonstrate the solution of 2 katas by use of whiteboard or the equivalent whiteboard tools.
​
- [ ] Used a whiteboard (real or virtual) as an aid to explain 2 solutions.
